Manual flying around with both x, y, z and yaw movement, tried to be done smoothly
Taking off after 12 seconds. 3 landmarks visible in the beginning (before taking off)
The end of the log should be removed as no landmarks are visible here (being the reason of the path diverging)
Based on "ManualFlightSmooth.bag"
